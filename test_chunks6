# 1. Formation and Content of Contract

The Purchase Order together with its attachments and other documents incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order constitutes an offer by Purchaser to have the Work specified therein performed by Supplier upon the terms and conditions, at the price(s), and within the period of time stated therein. Supplier shall indicate its acceptance of the offer by execution and return of the acknowledgment within seven (7) working days after receipt of the Purchase Order. If Supplier fails to notify Purchaser within this period of whether it accepts or objects to the Purchase Order, the Purchase Order is deemed accepted by Supplier, provided the Purchase Order, together with its attachments and other documents incorporated by reference into the Contract, substantially conforms to the agreements reached during the negotiations on the Supplier's proposal. Commencement of design, manufacture, delivery, supply of the Unit(s) or performance of the Services or start of invoicing constitutes Supplier's acceptance of the Purchase Order and the documents attached thereto or incorporated by reference into the Contract.

Unless otherwise stated in the Purchase Order, the contract (the "Contract") shall consist of the following documents exhaustively listed and the order of precedence shall be:

\* The Purchase Order together with Supplier's Purchase Order acknowledgment

\* The Master Technical Specification incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order

\* Quality Assurance plans including test and inspection requirements, incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order

\* Environmental, Health & Safety requirements, incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order

\* Shipping, packing and marking standards and instructions, incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order

\* Other documents incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order

\* Supplier's proposal

Terms and conditions of contracts of the Parties shall not apply even if the Parties or one of the Parties have not expressly contradicted their application.

The Contract may not be modified except by a written change order issued by Purchaser in accordance with Clause 3.2. No terms, conditions, exceptions or clarifications stated by Supplier in its proposal or in [UNREADABLE]

[No visible text in the top-left corner]

accepting or acknowledging the Purchase Order (including its attachments and other documents incorporated into the Contract by reference in the Purchase Order) shall be binding unless mutually agreed upon in writing and explicitly included in the Contract.

The invalidity, in whole or in part, of any provision of this Contract will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions or any other provision of this Contract. To the extent permissible under applicable law, this Contract replaces any prior agreement between the Parties that is inconsistent with its terms, and such replaced agreement shall be deemed to have been superseded by this Contract.
